feat: Implement personal thoughts and projects website

This commit introduces the initial version of the personal website,
featuring a unique road sign splash screen and dedicated sections for:

- Insights: A collection of distilled wisdom and reviews with tag filtering.
- Projects: Showcasing work like "The Conductor," with detailed operational
  flow and state diagrams.
- Waypoints: A curated list of external resources with category filtering.

The site is built using Astro with Svelte for interactive components,
and leverages GraphViz for dynamic diagram generation.
