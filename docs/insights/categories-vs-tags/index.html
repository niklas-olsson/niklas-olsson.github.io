<p>When curating a collection of resources, such as the “Waypoints” on this site, a common question arises: how best to organize them? Two primary methods often come to mind: <strong>categories</strong> and <strong>tags</strong>.</p>
<p>While seemingly similar, they serve distinct purposes and offer different levels of granularity for content organization and discoverability.</p>
<h2 id="categories-broad-buckets-for-primary-classification">Categories: Broad Buckets for Primary Classification</h2>
<p>Categories are best thought of as <strong>broad, mutually exclusive groups</strong>. Each item typically belongs to one, and only one, category. They help to segment your content into major, high-level topics.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hierarchical (often):</strong> While not strictly enforced, categories can sometimes imply a hierarchy (e.g., “Technology” > “AI/ML”).</li>
<li><strong>Limited Number:</strong> You generally have a relatively small, predefined set of categories.</li>
<li><strong>Primary Organization:</strong> They provide the main structure for navigating your content.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> On this site’s Waypoints, categories like “AI/ML”, “DevOps”, and “Research” serve as primary classifications.</p>
<h2 id="tags-granular-keywords-for-specificity">Tags: Granular Keywords for Specificity</h2>
<p>Tags, on the other hand, are <strong>granular, descriptive keywords</strong> that can be applied to an item. An item can (and often does) have multiple tags. They offer a more flexible and detailed way to describe the content.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-hierarchical:</strong> Tags are typically flat and don’t imply a parent-child relationship.</li>
<li><strong>Unlimited Number:</strong> You can have a large, evolving set of tags.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Discoverability:</strong> They allow users to find content based on very specific interests, even across different categories.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> An AI/ML link might be tagged with “Deep Learning”, “NLP”, “Python”, or “Frameworks”. A DevOps link might be tagged with “Containers”, “Orchestration”, or “Cloud”.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-which-and-why-both">When to Use Which (and Why Both)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Categories for broad filtering:</strong> If a user wants to see <em>all</em> content related to a major topic.</li>
<li><strong>Use Tags for specific filtering and cross-referencing:</strong> If a user wants to find content that touches on multiple, more niche topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a growing collection of resources, using both categories and tags provides a robust and flexible organization system. Categories offer the main structure, while tags provide the detailed pathways for exploration.</p>
<p>Adding tags, even if just for display initially, significantly enhances the context and discoverability of each waypoint. Implementing interactive tag filtering later can then unlock powerful search capabilities for your users.</p>
